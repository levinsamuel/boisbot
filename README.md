## Requirements

 - Python 3.6.x (I think something broke on python 3.7)
 - I used [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and virtualenvwrapper ([UNIX](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Windows](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper-win/))
 - [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) is installed and on your PATH. WARNING: I had an issue with this with Chromium installed. I was only able to get it working with Chrome.

## Installing

 1. Create a virtual environment for this project, see `virtualenv` above for documentation.
 2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` or
 3. `python setup.py install` or `python setup.py develop` as you please
